# API and Configuration

[node-mysql]: https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql
[node-mysql2]: https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2
[singlestore-docs]: https://docs.singlestore.com/

SingleStore Node.js Driver is mostly API compatible with [node-mysql2][node-mysql2] and [Node MySQL][node-mysql]. Since SingleStore is MySQL wire-protocol compatible, most existing MySQL client code works seamlessly.

## Known Incompatibilities

One known incompatibility is that `DECIMAL` values are returned as strings whereas in [Node MySQL][node-mysql] they are returned as numbers. This includes the result of `SUM()` and `AVG()` functions when applied to `INTEGER` arguments. This is done deliberately to avoid loss of precision - see https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/issues/935.

## Migration from MySQL2

SingleStore Node.js Driver is API-compatible with MySQL2, so migration is straightforward:

```javascript
// Before (MySQL2)
const mysql = require('mysql2');
const connection = mysql.createConnection({...});

// After (SingleStore Node.js Driver)
const singlestore = require('singlestore_nodejs');
const connection = singlestore.createConnection({...});

// All existing queries work as-is!
```
