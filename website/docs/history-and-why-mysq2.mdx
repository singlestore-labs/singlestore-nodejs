The SingleStore Node.js Driver is a fork of [mysql2][node-mysql2], adapted specifically for SingleStore database. Since SingleStore is MySQL wire-protocol compatible, most mysql2 features work seamlessly, with additional optimizations for SingleStore's distributed architecture and analytics capabilities.

SingleStore Node.js Driver is mostly API compatible with [mysql2][node-mysql2] and supports majority of features. This driver also offers these features optimized for SingleStore:

- **Faster / Better Performance** for distributed queries
- **Connection routing** to appropriate nodes (aggregator/leaf)
- **Support for ColumnStore and RowStore** tables
- **Real-time analytics** optimizations
- **Distributed query execution** handling
- **Pipeline data ingestion** support
- **Optimized batch inserts** for high-throughput scenarios
- [Prepared Statements](/docs/documentation/prepared-statements)
- MySQL Binary Log Protocol
- [MySQL Server](/docs/documentation/mysql-server)
- Extended support for Encoding and Collation
- [Promise Wrapper](/docs/documentation/promise-wrapper)
- Compression
- SSL and [Authentication Switch](/docs/documentation/authentication-switch)
- [Custom Streams](/docs/documentation/extras#connecting-using-custom-stream)
- [Pooling](/docs/#using-connection-pools)

## Why Choose SingleStore Node.js Driver?

This driver is specifically optimized for SingleStoreDB's unique architecture:

- **Distributed Architecture**: Efficiently handles queries across aggregator and leaf nodes
- **High Throughput**: Optimized for SingleStore's high-performance data ingestion capabilities
- **Real-time Analytics**: Built to leverage SingleStore's real-time analytics features
- **MySQL Compatibility**: Maintains full compatibility with MySQL wire protocol
