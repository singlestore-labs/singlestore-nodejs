The SingleStore Node.js Driver is a fork of [mysql2][node-mysql2], adapted specifically for SingleStore database. Since SingleStore is MySQL wire-protocol compatible, most mysql2 features work seamlessly.
SingleStore Node.js Driver is mostly API compatible with [node-mysql][node-mysql] and [node-mysql2][node-mysql2] and supports majority of features. This driver also offers these features optimized for SingleStore:

- [SingleStore Server][singlestore-docs]
- Extended support for Encoding and Collation
- [Promise Wrapper](/docs/documentation/promise-wrapper)
- Compression
- [Prepared Statements](/docs/documentation/prepared-statements)
- SSL and [Authentication Switch](/docs/documentation/authentication-switch)
- [Custom Streams](/docs/documentation/extras#connecting-using-custom-stream)
- [Pooling](/docs/#using-connection-pools)

- **Official SingleStore Support**: Officially supported by SingleStore for guaranteed compatibility and reliability
- **Consistent Data Type Handling**: Handles SingleStore data types more consistently than generic MySQL drivers
- **Configurable Connection Behavior**: Allows you to configure connection behavior by setting session variables
- **MySQL Compatibility**: Maintains full compatibility with MySQL wire protocol
